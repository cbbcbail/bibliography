# Tabular Visualization Tools

* A tool for producing tables from the National Bureau of Economic Statistics in 1975 including options for displaying the table and features of the table producing language.

    _The Table Producing Language of the Bureau of Labor Statistics_, NBER 1975

* A tool for interactive visualizations of tabular data including tables and matrix displays where data are shown with visual graphics arranged in tabular visualizations.

* The Table Lens is an interactive tool for exploring large tables by displaying some data values as rows in the table as the focus and aggregating the remaining data values not fully displayed as histograms to provide context.

    [@raoTableLensMerging1994]

* The Feature-Oriented Catalog USer (FOCUS) interface is an interactive table viewer with query support using the focus and context method presented in Table Lens with specific application to cases-by-attribute data.

* Visualization Spreadsheets is a spreadsheet approach for displaying and exploring visualizations particularly suited for large, abstract, and multidimensional datasets illustrating how spreadsheet methods can be powerful for visualization.

* ValueCharts is a set of visualizations and interactive techniques designed to facilitate a series of particular tasks in evaluation and decision making of linear models. The visualization is a tabular barchart or stacked barchart display.

* Skimmer is a system for browsing relational data query results by presenting the user with a set of representative tuples instead of facilitating scrolling. The representative tuples are selected to reduce information loss according to their metric and the resulting Skimmer system is evaluated in a usability study with four tasks Skimmer:

* Lineup is a visualization tool using stacked barcharts displayed in tabular visualizations. The system is designed to visualize rankings and aid users in ranking tasks. The system is evaluated in a user study with 12 tasks.

* Bertifier is an interactive web based tabular visualization tool for using spreadsheets to create and use Bertin matrices, visually encoded data in matrix form. The crosset widget and visual reordering interactive techniques build on the interactive capabilities of the Bertin matrix.

    [@perinRevisitingBertinMatrices2014]

* IF and FI (Item-Feature, Feature-Item) Tables display items and features vertically or horizontally for visualizing high dimensional data in tabular visualizations. Focus can be applied by the user through filtering by relevance and similarity.

    [@vandercorputExploringItemsFeatures2016]

* TACO is a visualization for comparison of the differences between two tables particularly designed for large and high dimensional datasets. Based on an overview+details concept, the two versions of the table are displayed as tabular heatmaps and the differences are highlighted in a color encoded aggregated pairwise comparison visualization.
