  abstract = {We investigate the use of a Fourier-domain derivative error kernel to quantify the error incurred while estimating the gradient of a function from scalar point samples on a regular lattice. We use the error kernel to show that gradient reconstruction quality is significantly enhanced merely by shifting the reconstruction kernel to the centers of the principal lattice directions. Additionally, we exploit the algebraic similarities between the scalar and derivative error kernels to design asymptotically optimal gradient estimation filters that can be factored into an infinite impulse response interpolation prefilter and a finite impulse response directional derivative filter. This leads to a significant performance gain both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The interpolation prefilter provides an accurate scalar approximation and can be re-used to cheaply compute directional derivatives on-the-fly without the need to store gradients. We demonstrate the impact of our filters in the context of volume rendering of scalar data sampled on the Cartesian and Body-Centered Cubic lattices. Our results rival those obtained from other competitive gradient estimation methods while incurring no additional computational or storage overhead.},

We contribute an understanding of, and indicators predicting how, large variations in viewing distances and viewing angles affect the accurate perception of angles, areas, and lengths. Our work, thus, helps visualization researchers with design considerations on how to create effective visualizations for these spaces. The first study showed that perception accuracy was impacted most when viewers were close to the wall but differently for each variable (Angle, Area, Length). Our second study examined the effect of perception when participants could move freely compared to when they had a static viewpoint. We found that a far but static viewpoint was as accurate but less time consuming than one that included free motion. Based on our findings, we recommend encouraging viewers to stand further back from the display when conducting perception estimation tasks. If tasks need to be conducted close to the wall display, important information should be placed directly in front of the viewer or above, and viewers should be provided with an estimation of the distortion effects predicted by our work-or encouraged to physically navigate the wall in specific ways to reduce judgement error.},

  abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

  abstract = {Numerate adults can represent an infinite array of integers. When a judgment requires them to ``pick a number,'' how do they select one to represent the abstract signal in mind? Drawing from research on the cognitive psychology of number representation, we conjecture that judges who operate primarily in decimal systems simplify by initially selecting from a set of chronically accessible ``Prominent Numbers'' defined as the powers of ten, their doubles, and their halves [{\dots} 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200{\dots}]; then, when willing and able, refining from there. A sample of 3\,billion stock trades reveals that traders' decisions reflect Prominent-Number clustering (Study 1) and a ``natural experiment'' reveals more clustering in rushed trading conditions (Study 2). Three sets of subsequent studies provide evidence consistent with an accessibility-based account of Prominent-Number usage: Experiments show that judges rely more on Prominent Numbers when they are induced to rush rather than take their time (Studies 3a and 3b), and when they are under high versus low cognitive load (Studies 4a, 4b, and 4c); and a final correlational study shows that Prominent-Number clustering is more apparent for judgments that require judges to scan a wider range of plausible values (Study 5). This work underscores the need to differentiate between Round Numbers and Prominent Numbers, and between representational properties of graininess and accessibility, in numerical judgment.},

Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

Results showed that gauge design impacted task completion times, eyes on-gauge duration and satisfaction. Horizontal gauges and pointer indicators were more efficient and less demanding visually. On the subjective side, circular and horizontal gauges were preferred by drivers. Specific gauge designs implied a gain in visual demand up to 250\,ms.

Although these methods are logically the same, such differences may affect the responses to the numerical estimations. In this study, we examined how differences in response format affected responses to numerical estimations using two behavioral experiments. We found that participants showed a round number bias (i.e., people answered estimates with round numbers) when simply stating a number and the distribution of responses tended to be less diverse. In contrast, this tendency was not observed when the participants responded using a scale. Participants provided more diverse estimates when they answered using a scale. Furthermore, we analyzed how this difference in response distribution was related to the wisdom of crowds (the aggregated judgment is as accurate as, or sometimes better than, the best individual judgment in the group) using computer simulations. The results indicated that round number bias affected the achievement of the wisdom of crowds. Particularly, when the group size was small, biased responses resulted in less effective achievement. Our findings suggest that using an appropriate scale is a low-cost method for eliminating round number bias and efficiently achieving the wisdom of crowds.},

However, when design choices emphasize means, users may overlook uncertainty information and misinterpret visual distance as a proxy for effect size. We present findings from a mixed design experiment on Mechanical Turk which tests eight uncertainty visualization designs: 95\% containment intervals, hypothetical outcome plots, densities, and quantile dotplots, each with and without means added. We find that adding means to uncertainty visualizations has small biasing effects on both magnitude estimation and decision-making, consistent with discounting uncertainty. We also see that visualization designs that support the least biased effect size estimation do not support the best decision-making, suggesting that a chart user's sense of effect size may not necessarily be identical when they use the same information for different tasks. In a qualitative analysis of users' strategy descriptions, we find that many users switch strategies and do not employ an optimal strategy when one exists. Uncertainty visualizations which are optimally designed in theory may not be the most effective in practice because of the ways that users satisfice with heuristics, suggesting opportunities to better understand visualization effectiveness by modeling sets of potential strategies.},

This approach has the problem that we end up with a very patchy understanding of the foundations of our field. More than that, there is a good amount of unproven assumptions, aesthetic judgments, etc. mixed in with the evidence. We often don't even realize how much we rely on the latter, and can't easily identify them because they have been so deeply incorporated into the fabric of our field. In this paper, I attempt to tease apart what we know and what we only think we know, using a few examples. The goal is to point out specific gaps in our knowledge, and to encourage researchers in the field to start questioning the underlying assumptions.

In this paper, we build on that study to test several pie chart variations that are popular in information graphics: exploded pie chart, pie with larger slice, elliptical pie, and square pie (in addition to a regular pie chart used as the baseline). We find that even variants that do not distort central angle cause greater error than regular pie charts. Charts that distort the shape show the highest error.

However, the effect of adding such decorative depth on the comprehension and recall of the graph's message has received little attention. The present study evaluated performance on such common graphical formats as line graphs, bar charts and pie charts constructed with and without the 3D look. When subjects were asked to make relative magnitude estimations, only the 3D line graphs resulted in reliable performance decrements. Likewise, information presented in 3D line graphs was remembered less accurately than information presented in 2D line graphs. For the estimation of global trends, both 3D line graphs and bar charts were used more quickly than 2D formats, but this speed was obtained at the expense of accuracy. For a trend classification task involving more focused processing, 3D line graphs and bar charts were associated with an overall performance decrement when compared with their 2D counterparts. Finally, the use of 3D designs, in addition to modifying performance, may influence the attitudes formed by subjects toward the information presented in the graphs.}

One of its main drawbacks concerns the difficulty to recover attributes of data samples accurately, which typically lie in the [0], [1] interval, given the locations of the low-dimensional embeddings and the vectors. In this paper we show that centering the data can considerably increase attribute estimation accuracy, where data values can be read off approximately by projecting embedded points onto calibrated (i.e., labeled) axes, similarly to classical statistical biplots. In addition, this idea can be coupled with a recently developed orthonormalization process on the axis vectors that prevents unnecessary distortions. We demonstrate that the combination of both approaches not only enhances the estimates, but also provides more faithful representations of the data.},

Even though pie charts have been around for over 200 years, our understanding of the perceptual factors used to read data in them is still limited. Data is encoded in pie and donut charts in three ways: arc length, center angle, and segment area. For our first study, we designed variations of pie charts to test the importance of individual encodings for reading accuracy. In our second study, we varied the inner radius of a donut chart from a filled pie to a thin outline to test the impact of removing the central angle. Both studies point to angle being the least important visual cue for both charts, and the donut chart being as accurate as the traditional pie chart.},

The series of experiments reported here suggests that there is little to choose between the pie and the bar chart, with the former enjoying a slight advantage if the required judgement is a complicated one, but that both forms of chart are superior to the table. Thus our results do not support the commonly expressed opinion that pie charts are inferior.

Applications of regression analysis include medical problems such as health estimation, environmental problems such as disaster prediction and energy consumption estimation, and business/economic analytics. Here, accuracy and quality of regression analysis strongly depend on relevancy between input explanatory variables and actual objective functions. It often happens that several explanatory variables are well correlated with objective functions while others do not well correlated, and therefore accuracy of regression analysis may improve by removing unnecessary explanatory variables. This paper presents a scatterplot-based regression analysis tool. This tool visualizes the distribution of errors between actual and estimated values of objective functions, and provides user interfaces to explore the relationships between explanatory variables and the errors. This paper introduces examples of the visualization results using the presented tool with actual and estimated revenues at a store.},

The selection of the techniques was based on their intended design, or use, for visually encoding data structures, that is, neighborhood relations between data points or groups of data points in a data set. Concretely, we study: the difference between the estimates of  k  as given by participants when using different multidimensional projections; the accuracy of user estimations with respect to the number of labels in the data sets; the perceived usability of each multidimensional projection; whether user estimates disagree with  k  values given by a set of cluster quality measures; and whether there is a difference between experienced and novice users in terms of estimates and perceived usability. The results show that: dendrograms (from Ward's hierarchical clustering) are likely to lead to estimates of  k  that are different from those given with other multidimensional projections, while Star Coordinates and Radial Visualizations are likely to lead to similar estimates; t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is likely to lead to estimates which are closer to the number of labels in a data set; cluster quality measures are likely to produce estimates which are different from those given by users using Ward and t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding; U-Matrices and reachability plots will likely have a low perceived usability; and there is no statistically significant difference between the answers of experienced and novice users. Moreover, as data dimensionality increases, cluster quality measures are likely to produce estimates which are different from those perceived by users using any of the assessed multidimensional projections. It is also apparent that the inherent complexity of a data set, as well as the capability of each visual technique to disclose such complexity, has an influence on the perceived usability.},

In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowdworkers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning.},
