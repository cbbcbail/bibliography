# Design and Uses of Tabular Visualization

* Gives some indication of how tables are perceived but not experimental results. Also gives indications of how tables are used and should be designed but again not experimental results.

    __J. Bertin__, "Semiologie Graphique", __1967__

* Includes notions of both good and bad table design practices but is asserted without experimental results. Asserts that ordering can be important in improving tabular visualization.
