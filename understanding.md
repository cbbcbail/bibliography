# Understanding of Tabular Visualization

* Gives some indication of how tables are perceived but not experimentally based. Also gives indications of how tables are used and should be designed but not experimentally based.

    __J. Bertin__, "Semiologie Graphique", __1967__

* Perception of bar charts, pie charts, and tables for the task of comparing proportions of components and combinations of components. They found poor performance for tables compared with the two summary visualizations for such tasks. They did not find ordering to have a significant effect on the task performance.

* Survey paper of perception studies for visualizations including tabular visualizations.

* Comparison of task performance on value retrieval, range, correlation, and a decision task comparing parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and tabular visualizations found that tables perform well for in terms of speed and accuracy for decision based tasks.

* Comparison of Amar-Eagan-Stasko low level task performances for tables, bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots and line charts reporting user accuracy, speed and preferences found that tables perform well for retrieval and computation tasks compared to other basic charts.

* Includes experiments comparing tables, bar tables, and bar charts for comparing ratio tasks. The findings show that tables promote unbiased reasoning and avoid problems of confirmation bias in comparison with bar charts by promoting the use of the ratio strategy.
