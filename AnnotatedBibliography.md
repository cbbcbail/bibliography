# Annotated Bibliography of Tabular Visualization


## Tabular Visualization Tools

* A tool for producing tables from the National Bureau of Economic Statistics in 1975 including options for displaying the table and features of the table producing language.

    _The Table Producing Language of the Bureau of Labor Statistics_, NBER 1975

* A tool for interactive visualizations of tabular data including tables and matrix displays where data are shown with visual graphics arranged in tabular visualizations.

    [@bensonInteractiveAnalysisDisplay1977]

* The Table Lens is an interactive tool for exploring large tables by displaying some data values as rows in the table as the focus and aggregating the remaining data values not fully displayed as histograms to provide context.

    [@raoTableLensMerging1994]

* The Feature-Oriented Catalog USer (FOCUS) interface is an interactive table viewer with query support using the focus and context method presented in Table Lens with specific application to cases-by-attribute data.

    [@spenkeFOCUSInteractiveTable1996]

* Visualization Spreadsheets is a spreadsheet approach for displaying and exploring visualizations particularly suited for large, abstract, and multidimensional datasets illustrating how spreadsheet methods can be powerful for visualization.

    [@chiPrinciplesInformationVisualization1998]

    * Subsequent sense-making analysis of their Visualization Spreadsheets.

        [@chiSensemakingEvolvingWeb1999]

* ValueCharts is a set of visualizations and interactive techniques designed to facilitate a series of particular tasks in evaluation and decision making of linear models. The visualization is a tabular barchart or stacked barchart display.

    [@careniniValueChartsAnalyzingLinear2004]

* Skimmer is a system for browsing relational data query results by presenting the user with a set of representative tuples instead of facilitating scrolling. The representative tuples are selected to reduce information loss according to their metric and the resulting Skimmer system is evaluated in a usability study with four tasks Skimmer:

* Lineup is a visualization tool using stacked barcharts displayed in tabular visualizations. The system is designed to visualize rankings and aid users in ranking tasks. The system is evaluated in a user study with 12 tasks.

    [@furmanovaTaggleCombiningOverview2020]

* Bertifier is an interactive web based tabular visualization tool for using spreadsheets to create and use Bertin matrices, visually encoded data in matrix form. The crosset widget and visual reordering interactive techniques build on the interactive capabilities of the Bertin matrix.

    [@perinRevisitingBertinMatrices2014]

* IF and FI (Item-Feature, Feature-Item) Tables display items and features vertically or horizontally for visualizing high dimensional data in tabular visualizations. Focus can be applied by the user through filtering by relevance and similarity.

    [@vandercorputExploringItemsFeatures2016]

* TACO is a visualization for comparison of the differences between two tables particularly designed for large and high dimensional datasets. Based on an overview+details concept, the two versions of the table are displayed as tabular heatmaps and the differences are highlighted in a color encoded aggregated pairwise comparison visualization.

    [@pajerWeightLifterVisualWeight2017]

* Visualization through aggregation techniques for tabular data.

    [@furmanovaTaggleCombiningOverview2020]

* Controlling level of detail information when creating visualizations using drag and drop methods for regions of tabular visualizations.

    [@whildenBlocksCreatingRich2022]

* Integrated visualization techniques for hierarchical tables.

    [@liHiTailorInteractiveTransformation2023]


## Understanding of Tabular Visualization

* Gives some indication of how tables are perceived but not experimentally based. Also gives indications of how tables are used and should be designed but not experimentally based.

    __J. Bertin__, "Semiologie Graphique", __1967__

* Perception of bar charts, pie charts, and tables for the task of comparing proportions of components and combinations of components. They found poor performance for tables compared with the two summary visualizations for such tasks. They did not find ordering to have a significant effect on the task performance.

    [@spenceDisplayingProportionsPercentages1991]

* Survey paper of perception studies for visualizations including tabular visualizations.

    [@quadriSurveyPerceptionBasedVisualization2022]

* Comparison of task performance on value retrieval, range, correlation, and a decision task comparing parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and tabular visualizations found that tables perform well for in terms of speed and accuracy for decision based tasks.

    [@dimaraConceptualMethodologicalIssues2018]


* Comparison of Amar-Eagan-Stasko low level task performances for tables, bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots and line charts reporting user accuracy, speed and preferences found that tables perform well for retrieval and computation tasks compared to other basic charts.

    [@saketTaskBasedEffectivenessBasic2019]

* Includes experiments comparing tables, bar tables, and bar charts for comparing ratio tasks. The findings show that tables promote unbiased reasoning and avoid problems of confirmation bias in comparison with bar charts by promoting the use of the ratio strategy.

    [@xiongReasoningAffordancesTables2022]


## Design and Uses of Tabular Visualization

* Gives some indication of how tables are perceived but not experimental results. Also gives indications of how tables are used and should be designed but again not experimental results.

    __J. Bertin__, "Semiologie Graphique", __1967__

* Includes notions of both good and bad table design practices but is asserted without experimental results. Asserts that ordering can be important in improving tabular visualization.

    [@ehrenbergRudimentsNumeracy1977]

    * Website with guidelines based on this work: [Guidelines for Designing Tables](https://understandinggraphics.com/design/data-table-design/)

* Tufte includes advice on the design and uses of tabular visualization although he makes a lot of assertions without experimental evidence.

    __E. Tufte__ "The visual display of quantitative information", _Graphics Press_, __1983__.

* The Derivation Problem for Summary Data.

    [@malvestutoDerivationProblemSummary1988]

* Includes notions of good and bad table design practices, and includes some theory about what you can and can't do with tabular visualizations.

    [@wainerUnderstandingGraphsTables1992]

* Includes a discussion of designing tables based on goals.

    [@wainerImprovingTabularDisplays1997]

* Ubiquity and uses of tables as spreadsheets and online visualizations.

    [@koestenTrialsTribulationsWorking2017]

* How interactive tables and spreadsheets are used by data workers and how effective they are: Untidy Data.
